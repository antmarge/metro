The goal of PAVE is to take RNA-Seq data and extract biologically relevant results into a simple summary of differentially expressed genes and ranked differentially expressed pathways for the given samples.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tuxedo Pipeline Workflow\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://pavetx.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/tuxedopipeline.jpg?w=1050\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Analysis Workflow\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://pavetx.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/pathway_de_gene_analysis.jpg?w=1332\">\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
