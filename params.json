{"name":"PAVE-Tx","tagline":"Pipeline for Analysis and Visualization of gene and pathway Expression --Transcriptome-directed","body":"\r\n### About PAVE\r\n\r\nPAVE is a transcriptomics-directed pipeline that enables analysis and visualization of differentially expressed genes and pathways.\r\n\r\nCreated by Margaret Antonio during the Charleston NSF REU for computational genomics.\r\nThe PAVE workflow consists of the TUXEDO Suite pipeline followed by custom-made Perl scripts and biological pathway databases, Reactome and Kegg. The goal of PAVE is to take RNA-Seq data and extract biologically relevant results into a simple summary of differentially expressed genes and ranked differentially expressed pathways for the given samples.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tuxedo Pipeline Workflow\r\n\r\n![Image of Tuxedo Pipeline workflow](https://pavetx.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/tuxedopipeline.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Analysis Workflow\r\n\r\n\r\n![Image of Analysis Workflow](https://pavetx.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/pathway_de_gene_analysis.jpg)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
