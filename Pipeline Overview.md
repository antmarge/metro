<h1>Transcriptome-Directed Pathway Analysis Pipeline</h1>

This pipeline was originally constructed for RNA-Seq data analysis. The first part of the pipeline consists of Tuxedo pipeline tools while the second part consists of original scripts written for extraction of differentially expressed pathways and genes.
